# LinakDeskEsp32Controller [![PlatformIO CI](https://github.com/TheRealMazur/LinakDeskEsp32Controller/actions/workflows/platformio_ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/TheRealMazur/LinakDeskEsp32Controller/actions/workflows/platformio_ci.yml)

The goal of this project is creating an easy to use bluetooth bridge for my Ikea Idasen desk, that uses a Linak controller.

I often switch computers, that's why the desktop controllers do not suit me, but they were a great source of information - you can see the links in the references section.  
Now it also offers Alexa support for voice controlling your desk!

# Features
* HTTP API and Web UI for:
   * Moving to a desired height
   * Getting the current height (also using the offset from Linak controller to get reading in cm)
   * Editing memory positions (Helpful to make the desk stop on correct height when moving manually)
* Amazon Alexa integration

# Web UI

At the root URL there is an Web UI for moving the desk and setting the favorite positions.

# Amazon Alexa integration

The project uses the [fauxmoESP](https://github.com/vintlabs/fauxmoESP) library to emulate a philips hue lightbulb that can be discovered and controlled by Alexa.
Current implementation uses Memory Position 3 as `on` state, and Memory Position 1 as `off` state.  
To move the desk to desired position you can just ask Alexa to turn on or off the desk using the desk name set during config, for example:  
**Alexa, turn on standing desk** (if you leave the default name - standing desk)


# Getting started
1. Compile the `esp32dev` environment and upload the binary to an esp32.
2. Connect to the Access Point starting with ESP_[...]
3. Fill out your WiFi credentials, desk name and desk Bluetooth address
4. Save your configuration and wait for the ESP to connect to WiFi and your desk.  
   (For the first connection you will need to press the pairing button on the desk.)
5. Test it! :)

Current implementation offers a simple HTTP GET API for getting the height and moving to height:
```
standing-desk.local/getHeight
```

```
standing-desk.local/moveToHeight?destination=700
```  
You can also use values in milimeters using:
```
standing-desk.local/getHeightMm
```

```
standing-desk.local/moveToHeightMm?destination=1000
```
Aditionally you can save current height as one of three (1-3) favorite positions to make the desk stop there when moving manually:
```
standing-desk.local/saveCurrentPosAsFav?position=3
``` 

mDNS name will be set from the desk name set in WiFiManager, with the spaces changed to `-`.

You can use the IP address of the device if you're having problems with mDNS

To change the settings reboot the ESP twice within 10 seconds and connect to the created WiFi.
